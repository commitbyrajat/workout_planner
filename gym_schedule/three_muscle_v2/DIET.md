## Calorie & Macro Calculation

### Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
Using Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:
- **BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5**
- BMR = (10 × 112) + (6.25 × 182) - (5 × 36) + 5
- BMR = 1120 + 1137.5 - 180 + 5
- **BMR = 2,082.5 calories/day**

### Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)
- **Activity Multiplier:** 1.725 (very active - 6 days/week intense training)
- **TDEE = 2,082.5 × 1.725 = 3,592 calories/day**

### Bulking Calorie Target
- **Surplus for Bulking:** +500 calories/day (for 0.5 kg/week gain)
- **BULKING TARGET: 4,100 calories/day**
