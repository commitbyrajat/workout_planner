## Calorie & Macro Calculation

### Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
Using Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:
- **BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5**
- BMR = (10 × 112) + (6.25 × 182) - (5 × 36) + 5
- BMR = 1120 + 1137.5 - 180 + 5
- **BMR = 2,082.5 calories/day**

### Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)
- **Activity Multiplier:** 1.725 (very active - 6 days/week intense training)
- **TDEE = 2,082.5 × 1.725 = 3,592 calories/day**

### Bulking Calorie Target
- **Surplus for Bulking:** +500 calories/day (for 0.5 kg/week gain)
- **BULKING TARGET: 4,100 calories/day**

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Early Morning Adaptation:** Your body will need 7-10 days to adjust to eating at 4:30 AM. Start with lighter pre-workout meals initially.

⚠️ **Sleep Priority:** With 4 AM wake-up, you're getting only 6 hours sleep. Aim for 10 PM sharp bedtime. Consider 20-min power nap post-lunch if possible.

⚠️ **Pre-Workout Digestion:** Keep Meal 1 light and easily digestible. Heavy meals before 5:30 AM workout may cause discomfort.

⚠️ **Adjustment Period:** Week 1-2 may feel overwhelming in volume. Start with 3,800 calories and gradually increase.

⚠️ **Digestion:** If experiencing bloating, reduce portion sizes slightly at Meals 2 or 4.

⚠️ **Weight Monitoring:** Weigh yourself every Sunday morning (empty stomach after bathroom). Target: 0.5-1 kg gain per month.

⚠️ **Flexibility:** You can swap similar items (chicken for fish, rice for rotis) while maintaining macros.

⚠️ **Family Time:** Dinner (7:00 PM) is designed as family meal time - share with kids but adjust their portions appropriately.
