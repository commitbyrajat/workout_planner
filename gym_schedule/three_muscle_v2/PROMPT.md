I am based out of Delhi and want to train during the duration 1st October to 31st December. Since this period will see a transition towards winter, create a workout plan accordingly to help me bulk up my muscles.

I want to grow muscles and gain strength. Looking for a 3 muscle group a day plan as follows:

**Weekly Split**

* Monday: Chest (Major), Back (Minor), Thigh (Minor)
* Tuesday: Shoulder (Major), Biceps (Minor), Triceps (Minor)
* Wednesday: Chest (Minor), Back (Major), Thigh (Minor)
* Thursday: Shoulder (Minor), Biceps (Major), Triceps (Minor)
* Friday: Chest (Minor), Back (Minor), Thigh (Major)
* Saturday: Shoulder (Minor), Biceps (Minor), Triceps (Major)

**Workout Plan Structure**

* Each day must contain 9 exercises.
* 60% of the exercises (6 exercises) must target the major muscle group of the day.
* 40% of the exercises (3 exercises) must target the minor muscle groups.
* After every major muscle exercise, there must be at least one exercise for a minor muscle.
* Exercises must be selected from the reference library provided.
* Since my gym does not have a Hack Squat machine, do not include Hack Squat in the plan.

**Workout Formats to Include**

* Superset: Perform two exercises back-to-back with no rest
* Drop Set: Reduce weight and continue after failure
* Pyramid Set: Increase or decrease weight each set
* Combo: One movement flows into another

**Plan Requirements**

1. Select targeted exercises for each muscle group from the given list (Chest, Back, Shoulders, Biceps, Triceps, Legs).
2. Tag each exercise with training count progression, for example: Flat Bench Press - Barbell – Middle Chest (1), Triceps (1).
3. Mention the benefit under every workout.
4. Define the utility of every workout session for both major and minor muscle groups, such as Strength & Hypertrophy, Compound & Stability Focus, Strength & Peak Focus, Definition & Strength, Compound Strength & Muscle Building, etc.
5. Mention the number of times per week each muscle group is trained.
6. Integrate Multi-Press Gym Machine variations where appropriate (Chest, Shoulder, Triceps).
7. The plan should be tailored to the October–December bulking phase with consideration for colder weather, supporting higher calorie intake, strength progression, and recovery.
