# Raw Dump

```
I want to grow muscles and gain strength. Looking for 3 muscle group a day plan like

Monday: Chest (Major),Back (Minor),Thigh (Minor)
Tuesday: Shoulder (Major),Biceps (Minor),Triceps (Minor)
Wednesday: Chest (Minor),Back (Major),Thigh (Minor)
Thursday: Shoulder (Minor),Biceps (Major),Triceps (Minor)
Friday: Chest (Minor),Back (Minor),Thigh (Major)
Saturday: Shoulder (Minor),Biceps (Minor),Triceps (Major)


refer the following excercises and create a workout plan. Include following formats.

Superset: Perform two exercises back-to-back with no rest
Drop Set: Reduce weight & continue after failure
Pyramid Set: Increase or decrease weight each set
Combo: One movement flows into another

Also, Mention the number of times each muscle is getting trained. Mention the increasing count in each excersise like Flat Bench Press - Barbell – (Middle Chest (1), Triceps (1))

Define utility of every workout major/minor workout session like Strength & Hypertrophy, Compound & Stability Focus, Strength & Peak Focus, Definition & Strength, Compound Strength & Muscle Building etc.

Serratus Anterior & Subclavius Focus (Can be done separately or as an add-on)
- Landmine Press


Back
Lats (Latissimus Dorsi) (For width and thickness)
- Pull-Ups (Wide Grip or Weighted) – Best for overall lat development.
- Lat Pulldown (Wide or Close Grip) – Works the entire lat structure.
- Bent-Over Barbell Rows – Builds both lat thickness and lower back strength.
- T-Bar Row – Adds thickness and overall mass to the lats.
- Behind-the-Neck Lat Pulldown – (Targets upper lats & teres major, improves scapular mobility)

Upper Traps (For a thick upper back & posture support)
- Face Pulls (Cable or Resistance Band) – Activates upper traps and prevents imbalances.
- Barbell Shrugs
- Upright Rowing (Barbell or Dumbbells)

Spinae Erector (Erector Spinae) (For lower back strength and injury prevention)
- Deadlifts (Conventional or Romanian) – The king of lower back exercises.
- Hyperextensions (Weighted or Bodyweight) – Strengthens the erector spinae without spinal compression.

Lower Traps (For Shoulder Stability & Posture Correction)
- Barbell Overhead Press (Behind-the-Neck) - Engages rear delts, traps, and upper back for complete strength development.
- Reverse Pec Deck (Rear Delt Machine) 
- Cable Scapular Retraction (seated rowing)

Rotator Cuff (For Shoulder Stability & Injury Prevention)
- Cable External Rotations (Single Arm) – (Targets infraspinatus & teres minor, improves shoulder mobility)
- Prone Dumbbell External Rotations – (Targets supraspinatus, enhances rotator cuff endurance)
- Behind-the-Back Cable Raises – (Engages rotator cuff & rear delts, improves scapular stability)

Teres Major (For Back Width & Shoulder Mobility)
- Pull-Ups (Underhand Grip)
- One-Arm Lat Pulldown
- Chest-Supported Machine Row (Neutral or Underhand Grip) – (More stability, isolates teres major & lats without excessive momentum)

Barbell Back Squat - (Quadriceps) - (Best compound movement for quad dominance & full-leg growth)
Lying Leg Curls (Machine or Resistance Band) - (Hamstrings) - (Stable, controlled movement to target hamstrings fully)

Legs
Quadriceps – For Size & Strength
- Barbell Back Squat – (Best compound movement for quad dominance & full-leg growth)
- Leg Press (Feet Low & Close Stance) – 3 sets × 10-12 reps (Isolates quads, adds volume with controlled reps)
- Hack Squats (Machine or Barbell) – 3 sets × 10-12 reps (Provides better knee stability while deeply engaging quads)

Adductors – For Inner Thigh Strength & Stability
- Sumo Deadlifts – (Engages adductors while strengthening glutes & hamstrings)
- Jefferson Squats (Barbell or Dumbbells) – (Builds inner thigh & core strength with a unique stance)
- Lateral Lunges (Dumbbell or Bodyweight) – (Improves hip mobility & strengthens inner thighs dynamically)

Hamstrings – For Posterior Chain Strength
- Romanian Deadlifts (Barbell or Dumbbell) – 4 sets × 8-10 reps (Best for hamstring stretch & strength development)
- Lying Leg Curls (Machine or Resistance Band) – (Stable, controlled movement to target hamstrings fully)

Calves – For Size & Endurance
- Standing Calf Raises (Machine or Barbell) – (Best for gastrocnemius development & overall calf growth)
- Leg Press Calf Raises – (Targets both gastrocnemius & soleus with heavy resistance)
- Smith Machine Calf Raises - (Provides stability & allows for progressive overload)

Glutes – For Power & Lower Body Strength
- Barbell Hip Thrusts – (Best for glute hypertrophy & explosive strength)
- Cable Kickbacks (Glute Focus) – (Isolates glutes, improving mind-muscle connection)
- Bulgarian Split Squats (Dumbbell or Barbell) – (Targets glutes & improves unilateral strength and stability)
