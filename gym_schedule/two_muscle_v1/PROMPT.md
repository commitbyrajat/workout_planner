@workout

I want to grow muscles and gain strength. Looking for 2 muscle group a day plan like

Monday: Chest (Major),Back (Minor)
Tuesday: Biceps (Major),Triceps (Minor)
Wednesday: Shoulder (Major),Thigh (Minor)
Thursday: Chest (Minor),Back (Major)
Friday: Biceps (Minor),Triceps (Major)
Saturday: Shoulder (Minor),Thigh (Major)

Create plan in a way that everyday that after every major muscle excercise there must be an excercise for minor muscle. 

Refer the following excercises and create a workout plan. Include following formats.

Superset: Perform two exercises back-to-back with no rest
Drop Set: Reduce weight & continue after failure
Pyramid Set: Increase or decrease weight each set
Combo: One movement flows into another

Also, Mention the number of times each muscle is getting trained. Mention the increasing count in each excersise like Flat Bench Press - Barbell – (Middle Chest (1), Triceps (1))
Mention the benefit under every workout.

Define utility of every workout major/minor workout session like Strength & Hypertrophy, Compound & Stability Focus, Strength & Peak Focus, Definition & Strength, Compound Strength & Muscle Building etc.

My gym doesn't have machine for Hack Squat.

Out of 8 excersices everyday. 60 % must be of major muscle. and 40 % targets minor muscle.

- T-Bar Row – Adds thickness and overall mass to the lats.
- Behind-the-Neck Lat Pulldown – (Targets upper lats & teres major, improves scapular mobility)

Upper Traps (For a thick upper back & posture support)

- Upright Rowing (Barbell or Dumbbells)

Spinae Erector (Erector Spinae) (For lower back strength and injury prevention)

- Behind-the-Back Cable Raises – (Engages rotator cuff & rear delts, improves scapular stability)

Teres Major (For Back Width & Shoulder Mobility)

Legs
Quadriceps – For Size & Strength
- Barbell Back Squat – (Best compound movement for quad dominance & full-leg growth)
- Leg Press (Feet Low & Close Stance) – 3 sets × 10-12 reps (Isolates quads, adds volume with controlled reps)
- Hack Squats (Machine or Barbell) – 3 sets × 10-12 reps (Provides better knee stability while deeply engaging quads)

Adductors – For Inner Thigh Strength & Stability
- Sumo Deadlifts – (Engages adductors while strengthening glutes & hamstrings)

Hamstrings – For Posterior Chain Strength

- Lying Leg Curls (Machine or Resistance Band) – (Stable, controlled movement to target hamstrings fully)

Calves – For Size & Endurance
- Standing Calf Raises (Machine or Barbell) – (Best for gastrocnemius development & overall calf growth)

@diet
1. I'm targeting significant weight loss along with improved heart health and liver functions. 
2. I'm based out of Delhi, India. Suggest an vegetarian diet plan that can be easily prepared in an Indian kitchen. 
3. The diet plan must also help to recover from the fatigue and weakness from above workout plan.
4. Recreate plan.Add benefits and effect of every item alongside in a meal. 
5. Also, replace banana with some other fruit like apple, orange or something else.
