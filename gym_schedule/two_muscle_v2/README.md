## Sunday: Rest Day or Light Activity
Consider light walking, swimming, or yoga for active recovery. Focus on hydration, proper nutrition, and getting adequate sleep in the Delhi heat.

## Training Notes for Delhi Summer:
- Hydrate more aggressively than usual (aim for 4-5 liters of water daily)
- Consider adding electrolytes to water, especially on leg and back days
- Train early morning (5-7 AM) or evening (after 7 PM) to avoid peak heat
- Adjust workout intensity based on heat and humidity levels
- Consider indoor air-conditioned facilities when possible
- Rest periods: 60-90 seconds between regular sets, 90-120 seconds for supersets and after drop sets
- Keep a cool towel and extra water bottle nearby

## Muscle Training Frequency:
- Chest: 9 times (5 major, 4 minor)
- Back: 9 times (5 major, 4 minor)
- Shoulders: 10 times (5 major, 5 minor)
- Biceps: 8 times (5 major, 3 minor)
- Triceps: 10 times (5 major, 5 minor)
- Legs/Thighs: 10 times (5 major, 5 minor)
- Hamstrings: 3 times (all minor)
- Calves: 2 times (all major)
- Forearms: 1 time (minor)

This plan provides balanced development with appropriate volume distribution despite the challenging Delhi summer climate, ensuring proper recovery between sessions while maximizing growth stimulus.
